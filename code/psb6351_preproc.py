# NODE 11: SPATIAL SMOOTHING
# You have a couple of options here...
# If you want to smooth isotropically you can use either AFNI's 3dmerge or FSL's fslmath
# For AFNI's implementation within the context of nipype check out the following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.utils.Merge
# For FSL's implementation within the context of nipype check out hte following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.Smooth
# QUESTIONS TO ANSWER...
# Q1 - What does isotropic mean?
#      A: Isotropic means the same in every direction. So an isotropic 6mm kernel
#         blurs 6mm in x, y, and z equally, instead of blurring more in one direction
#         than another.
# Q2 - What are the pros and cons of isotropic spatial smoothing?
#      A: The main pro is that smoothing averages out random noise, so the signal to
#         noise ratio goes up. It also helps at the group level because everyone's
#         brain is a little different, and blurring makes activations line up better
#         across subjects. Smoothing also makes the data fit the assumptions of
#         Gaussian random field theory better, and it's simple and easy to report.
#         The cons are that you lose spatial resolution. Small activations can get
#         washed out and two nearby activations can blend into one. Since it's
#         isotropic it doesn't care about anatomy, so grey matter gets blurred with
#         white matter, CSF, and even voxels outside the brain. Picking the kernel
#         size is also kind of arbitrary, and too much smoothing could hurt MVPA
#         type analyses that depend on fine grained patterns.
# AFNI has some cool tools to help control the final smoothness of your data
# Specifically 3dBlurToFWHM, this function will estimate your intrinsic smoothness and iteratively
# spatially blur up until it achieves a targeted smoothness
# Q3 - Why might this be good?  Are there any potential cons?
#      A: This is nice because everyone ends up with the same final smoothness.
#         If you just apply a 6mm kernel, it gets added on top of however smooth the
#         data already were, and that differs between subjects, runs, and scanners.
#         The downsides are that it's slow since it keeps iterating, and the target
#         has to be bigger than the smoothest dataset you have. It also depends on
#         estimating smoothness, which can be thrown off by motion or artifacts,
#         and it still smooths across tissue types like regular Gaussian smoothing.
# If you intend to use AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM check out hte following page:
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.BlurToFWHM
# NOTE: If you elect to use this one be careful on how big you make your
# kernel as this process is iterative and can take some time
# FSL has some cool tools that help ensure that you spatially smooth like voxels
# This is FSL's SUSAN algorithm, this function will use intensities in voxels
# to constrain smoothing to like intensities (smooth only grey matter with grey matter)
# Q4 - Why might his be good? Cons (hint: begins with an 'e' and ends with 'ge' effects)?
#      How might the cons influence Gaussian Random Field Theory?
#      A: SUSAN is good because it only averages together voxels with similar
#         intensity, so you still get the noise reduction but grey matter signal
#         doesn't bleed into white matter or CSF. The con is edge effects. 
#	  Gaussian random field theory assumes the smoothness is uniform and
#         can be estimated, so with SUSAN those estimates could be off and the
#         corrected thresholds could end up too strict in some places and too
#         lenient in others.
#
# If you choose an isotropic approach or AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM you need
# to add just a single node here.
#
# If you choose to use the FSL SUSAN approach, you'll need to add the following
# NODE 1 - FreeSurferSource node, define subjects_dir as the project's freesurfer directory
#          and define subject_id as the subject id
# NODE 2 - You will need to make a brain only mask.  I'm going to guide you to use freesurfers aparc+aseg
#          To do this you'll use freesurfer's binarize function
#          binarizing all values in the aparc+aseg file that are greater than 0.5
#          For this node to work connect the fssource node and in the connection syntax
#          imbed the get_aparc_aseg function that is already defined for you above
#          Use this node to also dilate your brian only mask in T1w space by 1 voxel
# NODE 3 - Now you have a brain only mask in T1w space...you need to move this into the
#          EPI space by applying the volume transform from T1w space into EPI space
#          NOTE: This step is best implemented if you used Freesurfer's BBREGISTER for coregistration
#          You have to define where you're going aka 'source_file' and what is moving aka 'target_file'
#          You have to pass the registration matrix file derived from your coregistration node
#          You also have to choose an interpolation...
# Q5 - why is nearest neighbor interpolation correct here? What is nearest neighbor interpolation?
#      A: Nearest neighbor interpolation just gives each new voxel the value of
#         whichever original voxel is closest, instead of averaging nearby voxels
#         like trilinear or sinc interpolation does. Our mask only has 0s and 1s,
#         and we want to keep it that way. Nearest neighbor can
#         only output values that were already in the image, so it stays 0 or 1.
# NODE 4 - Now use the mask that is in EPI space to mask the EPI image by voxels that only cover the brain
#          you can use FSL's fslmaths and the '-mas' flag to work here
# NODE 5 - Get the median of your EPI data using FSL's fslmath with the following op_string = '-k %s -p 50'
# NODE 6 - Get the mean of your EPI data using FSL's fslmath with the following op_string = '-Tmean'
# NODE 7 - Use Nipype's util.Merge function to take in 2 inputs and horizontal stack the (aka., 'hstack')
#          Define your first input as the mean EPI from NODE 6 and your second input as the median EPI from NODE 5
# NODE 8 - Now you have all you need to implement the SUSAN smooth node
#          Pass a list of variable smoothing kernel FWHM sizes, use a mapnode to iterate over them
#          What else needs to be in your iterfield?
# NODE DATASINK - Modify your datasink node to collect the smoothed output files so you can visualize

# NODE 12: TEMPORAL FILTERING OR SMOOTHING
# I want you to add a node here to temporally filter the functional data --> should this be a mapnode or regular node?
# If the functional EPI data are resting state data I want you to implement a 
# bandpass filter. If the functional EPI data are task data I want you to implement
# a highpass filter.
# Q6 - why bandpass resting state but only highpass task EPI data?
# I want you to utilize either the FSL tools implementing fslmaths, what op_string flag would you need?
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.html#nipype.interfaces.fsl.utils.ImageMaths
# Or you can use AFNI's 3dBandpass function
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.preprocess.Bandpass
# If you use AFNI's tool and you only highpass filter, how do you set your fbot and ftop?
# If you are electing to use the Discrete Cosine Tranforms (DCTs) to statistically account for low frequency noise
# you'll need to run a regression model.
# For this step I would recommend utilizing AFNI's 3dDeconvolve paired with 3dREMLfit
# First using 3dDeconvolve you'll need to 
# define your legendre input as True and your number of polorts as an integer - try 7..
# you can also make the x1D_stop flag True as you don't need to run the 3dDeconvolve as 3dREMLfit does the heavy lifting here
# create another node for the 3dREMLfit passing the x1D matrix from the 3dDeconvolve node and save in your datasink the residuals
# https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/generated/nipype.interfaces.afni.model.html#nipype.interfaces.afni.model.Deconvolve
# 
# If you're feeling ambitious you can implement multiple approaches and compare/contrast them
#
# Q6 answer: Both kinds of data have slow drift from things like scanner heating and
# physiology, so both need a highpass filter. With resting state, the signal we care
# about is the slow spontaneous fluctuations (around 0.01-0.1 Hz), so anything faster
# than that, like cardiac and breathing noise, can be filtered out too, which is why
# it gets a bandpass. With task data the signal we care about is the response to the
# task, and depending on the design (especially event-related designs) some of that
# signal is at higher frequencies. A lowpass filter could remove real task signal,
# and the GLM already deals with high frequency noise, so we only highpass.
#
# Our runs (task-loc and task-study) are task data, so I only highpass filtered.
# I used fslmaths -bptf with the lowpass sigma set to -1 so it's turned off.
# The sigma is in volumes, not seconds: sigma = cutoff / (2 * TR). I went with
# FSL's default 100s cutoff, so sigma = 100 / (2 * 1.76) = 28.41 volumes, which
# removes anything slower than 0.01 Hz.
# I made it a MapNode because fslmaths works on one run at a time and we have
# several runs.
# Newer versions of FSL remove the mean of each voxel when you use -bptf, so I add
# the mean image back in after filtering.
